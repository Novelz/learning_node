/**
 * # Installa a global npm package
 * 
 * To install and use nodemon we need to install it with a slightly different command
 * > npm install nodemon -g
 * 
 * The -g flag stands for "global" and the package will be installed on the OS
 * As you can see it isn't referred in any package or package-lock file
 * 
 * We can then simply use the nodemon module in the terminal with the nodemon command
 * 
 * Terminal command:
 * > npm install nodemon -g
 * > nodemon app.js
 *
